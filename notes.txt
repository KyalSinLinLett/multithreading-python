Multiprocessing and multithreading both are ways to achieve multitasking 

Threads live within the same process
threads will share the same virtual memory - but have their own stack, instruction pointer

Process can create multiple threads within it
It has its own address space
Benefits of multiprocessing is that error or memory leak in one process wont hurt execution
of another process


Use process locks to manage R/W or I/O of shared resources between processes

Usually a process runs on a single core that the OS chooses/
Through multiprocessing pool, we can utilize all cores and parallelize our program
the act of dividing inputs for each core => MAP
the act of aggregating the outputs back from each core => REDUCE
